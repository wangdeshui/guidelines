# Coding Guidelines for C# 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 Cheat Sheet

## Basic Principles
* The Principle of Least Surprise
* Keep It Simple Stupid
* You Ain’t Gonne Need It
* Don’t Repeat Yourself


## Class Design
* A class or interface should have a single purpose
* An interface should be small and focused
* Use an interface to decouple classes from each other
* Don’t hide inherited members with the new keyword
* It should be possible to treat a derived object as if it were
a base class object 
* Don’t refer to derived classes from the base class
* Avoid exposing the objects an object depends on
* Avoid bidirectional dependencies 
* Classes should have state and behavior 


## Member Design
* Allow properties to be set in any order
* Don’t use mutual exclusive properties 
* A method or property should do only one thing 
* Don’t expose stateful objects through static members
* Return an IEnumerable<T> or ICollection<T> instead
of a concrete collection class
* Properties, methods and arguments representing strings
or collections should never be null 
* Define parameters as specific as possible 
  
 
## Miscellaneous Design
* Throw exceptions rather than returning status values
* Provide a rich and meaningful exception message text
* Don’t swallow errors by catching generic exceptions
* Always check an event handler delegate for null
* Properly handle exceptions in asynchronous code
* Use a protected virtual method to raise each event
* Don’t pass null as the sender parameter when raising an event
* Use generic constraints if applicable
* Evaluate the result of a LINQ expression before returning it 

## Maintainability
* Methods should not exceed 7 statements 
* Make all members private and types internal by default

* Avoid conditions with double negatives 
* Don’t use "magic numbers" 
* Only use var when the type is very obvious 
* Declare and initialize variables as late as possible

* Favor Object and Collection Initializers over separate
statements 
* Don’t make explicit comparisons to true or false

* Don’t change a loop variable inside a for or foreach
loop 
* Avoid nested loops 
  
 
* Always add a block after keywords such if, else, while,
for, foreach and case 
* Always add a default block after the last case in a switch
statement 
* Finish every if-else-if statement with an else-part

* Be reluctant with multiple return statements 
* Don’t use if-else statements instead of a simple
(conditional) assignment	
* Encapsulate complex expressions in a method or
property 
* Call the most overloaded method from other overloads

* Only use optional arguments to replace overloads

* Avoid using named arguments 
* Don’t allow methods and constructors with more than
three parameters 
* Don’t use ref or out parameters 
* Avoid methods that take a bool flag 
* Always check the result of an as operation 
* Don’t comment-out code 


## Framework Guidelines
* Use C# type aliases instead of the types from the System
namespace 
* Build with the highest warning level 
* Use Lambda expressions instead of delegates 
* Only use the dynamic keyword when talking to a dynamic
object 
* Favor async/await over the Task

Read-only static field	RedValue
Method	ToString
Namespace	System.Drawing
Property	BackColor
Type Parameter	TEntity
Camel Casing
Private field	listItem
Variable	listOfValues
Const variable	maximumItems
Parameter	typeName

## Naming
* Use US English 
* Don’t include numbers in variables, parameters and type
members	
* Don’t prefix fields 
* Don’t use abbreviations 
* Name an member, parameter or varialbe according its
meaning and not its type 
* Name types using nouns, noun phrases or adjective
phrases 
* Don’t repeat the name of a class or enumeration in its
members 
* Avoid short names or names that can be mistaken with
other names 
* Name methods using verb-object pair 
* Name namespaces using names, layers, verbs and
features 
* Use an underscore for irrelevant lambda parameters

  
 
## Documentation
* Write comments and documentation in US English

* Document all public, protected and internal types and
members 
* Avoid inline comments 
* Only write comments to explain complex algorithms or
decisions 
* Don’t use comments for tracking work to be done later


## Layout
* Maximum line length is 130 characters.
* Indent 4 spaces, don’t use Tabs
* Keep one whitespace between keywords like if and the
expression, but don’t add whitespaces after ( and
before ).
* Add a whitespace around operators, like +, -, ==, etc.
* Always add parentheses after keywords if, else, do,
while, for and foreach
* Always put opening and closing parentheses on a new
line.
* Don’t indent object Initializers and initialize each
property on a new line.
* Don’t indent lambda statements
* Put the entire LINQ statement on one line, or start each
keyword at the same indentation.
* Add braces around comparison conditions, but don’t add
braces around a singular condition.
  
 
## Empty lines
* Between members
* After the closing parentheses
* Between multi-line statements
* Between unrelated code blocks
* Around the #region keyword
* Between the using statements of different companies.


## Member order
1.	Private fields and constants
2.	Public constants
3.	Public read-only static fields
4.	Factory Methods
5.	Constructors and the Finalizer
6.	Events
7.	Public Properties
8.	Other methods and private properties in calling
order
