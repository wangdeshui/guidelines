#Coding Guidelines for C# 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 Cheat Sheet##Basic Principles* The Principle of Least Surprise* Keep It Simple Stupid* You Ain’t Gonne Need It* Don’t Repeat Yourself##Class Design* A class or interface should have a single purpose* An interface should be small and focused* Use an interface to decouple classes from each other* Don’t hide inherited members with the new keyword* It should be possible to treat a derived object as if it werea base class object * Don’t refer to derived classes from the base class* Avoid exposing the objects an object depends on* Avoid bidirectional dependencies * Classes should have state and behavior ##Member Design* Allow properties to be set in any order* Don’t use mutual exclusive properties * A method or property should do only one thing * Don’t expose stateful objects through static members* Return an IEnumerable<T> or ICollection<T> insteadof a concrete collection class* Properties, methods and arguments representing stringsor collections should never be null * Define parameters as specific as possible    ##Miscellaneous Design* Throw exceptions rather than returning status values* Provide a rich and meaningful exception message text* Don’t swallow errors by catching generic exceptions* Always check an event handler delegate for null* Properly handle exceptions in asynchronous code* Use a protected virtual method to raise each event* Don’t pass null as the sender parameter when raising an event* Use generic constraints if applicable* Evaluate the result of a LINQ expression before returning it ##Maintainability* Methods should not exceed 7 statements * Make all members private and types internal by default* Avoid conditions with double negatives * Don’t use "magic numbers" * Only use var when the type is very obvious * Declare and initialize variables as late as possible* Favor Object and Collection Initializers over separatestatements * Don’t make explicit comparisons to true or false* Don’t change a loop variable inside a for or foreachloop * Avoid nested loops    * Always add a block after keywords such if, else, while,for, foreach and case * Always add a default block after the last case in a switchstatement * Finish every if-else-if statement with an else-part* Be reluctant with multiple return statements * Don’t use if-else statements instead of a simple(conditional) assignment	* Encapsulate complex expressions in a method orproperty * Call the most overloaded method from other overloads* Only use optional arguments to replace overloads* Avoid using named arguments * Don’t allow methods and constructors with more thanthree parameters * Don’t use ref or out parameters * Avoid methods that take a bool flag * Always check the result of an as operation * Don’t comment-out code ##Framework Guidelines* Use C# type aliases instead of the types from the Systemnamespace * Build with the highest warning level * Use Lambda expressions instead of delegates * Only use the dynamic keyword when talking to a dynamicobject * Favor async/await over the Task   ##Pascal CasingClass,

member, parameter or varialbe according itsmeaning and not its type * Name types using nouns, noun phrases or adjectivephrases * Don’t repeat the name of a class or enumeration in itsmembers * Avoid short names or names that can be mistaken withother names * Name methods using verb-object pair * Name namespaces using names, layers, verbs andfeatures * Use an underscore for irrelevant lambda parameters   ##Documentation* Write comments and documentation in US English* Document all public, protected and internal types andmembers * Avoid inline comments * Only write comments to explain complex algorithms ordecisions * Don’t use comments for tracking work to be done later##Layout* Maximum line length is 130 characters.* Indent 4 spaces, don’t use Tabs* Keep one whitespace between keywords like if and theexpression, but don’t add whitespaces after ( andbefore ).* Add a whitespace around operators, like +, -, ==, etc.* Always add parentheses after keywords if, else, do,while, for and foreach* Always put opening and closing parentheses on a newline.* Don’t indent object Initializers and initialize eachproperty on a new line.* Don’t indent lambda statements* Put the entire LINQ statement on one line, or start eachkeyword at the same indentation.* Add braces around comparison conditions, but don’t addbraces around a singular condition.   ##Empty lines* Between members* After the closing parentheses* Between multi-line statements* Between unrelated code blocks* Around the #region keyword* Between the using statements of different companies.##Member order1.
