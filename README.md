==========

### Readable is most important
### Don't worry the name is too long if it helps to read
### Don't worry the files is too much if it's more SRP
### Don't worry the classes is too much if it's more SRP
### Keep the code shorter while the code is readable
### Keep the code simple if it's easy to read
